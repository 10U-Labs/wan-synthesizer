# SEQUENCE

Dependency order across `src/` — common infra, endpoints, and HTTP actions.
Each node is one workflow (`api_common_*`, `api_endpoint_*`). `A ─→ B` means B
builds on A: every endpoint reads the common `storage` + `routing` state, a
carrier/tenant write cascades to its builder (`carriers/merge`,
`tenants/wan`), and the `tenants/wan` POST workflow
(`*_post.yml`) lints, tests, and deploys the synthesizer's own stack
(`tenants/wan/post`, named after the workflow that owns it). The `tenants/wan`
dispatcher stack invokes the synthesizer by its deterministic derived name (from the
common module), so the two stacks stay decoupled -- each workflow owns and deploys
its own stack.
