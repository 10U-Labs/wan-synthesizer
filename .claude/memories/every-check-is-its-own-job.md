## Overview

A push should tell its author everything that is wrong with it, in one run. Until GitHub issue #56 it told them one thing: the eleven static-analysis checks ran as eleven steps of a single `static-analysis` job, a job stops at its first failing step, and the checks behind a failure never ran. Three findings that were all true of the same change cost four pushes and fourteen minutes on 2026-08-03 — 6397ae8 failed at `Run pylint on tests`, c68f309 six minutes later at `Run mypy on tests`, e7acadd five minutes after that at the 100% coverage gate on 99.84%, and e2f5355 was green.

## Conventions

### Each job installs only what it runs

Each job installs only what it runs: `yamllint` alone for `lint-yaml`, each `assert-*` tool alone for its own job, `jscpd` alone for the two copy-paste jobs, no `pip install` at all for `validate-stack`, and `pylint` or `mypy` plus the libraries and stubs the linted code imports for the four `pylint` and `mypy` jobs. A job that installed the whole list would spend more on setup than on checking — in run 30795210987 the old single job spent 14 seconds on the runner, the checkout and `pip install`, and 24 on the eleven checks.

### Eleven checks, eleven jobs

Each check is a job now. In every `api_*.yml` workflow they are `lint-yaml`, `assert-no-inline-directives`, `assert-no-linter-config-files`, `assert-one-assert-per-pytest`, `pylint-source`, `mypy-source`, `copy-paste-source`, `pylint-tests`, `mypy-tests`, `copy-paste-tests` and `validate-stack`; `seed.yml` has eleven checks too, counting `yamllint` and `assert-no-test-only-python-definition`: no `validate-stack`, deploying no OpenTofu of its own, and no `lint-yaml`, its own `yamllint` job already linting the one file `lint-yaml` there was pointed at. None of the eleven reads what another writes, so they all start when the workflow does. The jobs sit in alphabetical order in the file because `yamllint` runs here with `key-ordering: enable`, which is why `validate-stack` is written at the bottom next to `unit-tests` rather than beside the checks it belongs with.

### Four edges survive in an api workflow

Four edges survive in an `api_*.yml` workflow, and each is there for a reason a concurrent graph does not supply.

- `unit-tests` needs `test-repo-libraries`, and `pre-deployment-integration-tests` needs it too. See [shared-modules-are-tested-first](shared-modules-are-tested-first.md): a reader facing red consumers across the workflows has to be told which shared module broke them.
- `reconciliation` needs every gate in the workflow — the eleven checks, `test-repo-libraries`, `unit-tests` and `pre-deployment-integration-tests` — because on `main` it runs `tofu apply` against live AWS. A tier's result can be disbelieved after the fact; an apply cannot be taken back, so nothing that failed a check gets deployed.
- `post-deployment-integration-tests` needs `reconciliation`, because it measures what was deployed.

### seed.yml gates its checks on nothing

`seed.yml` takes the same split, and all eleven of its checks are gated on nothing at all: `assert-no-comments`, `assert-no-inline-directives`, `assert-no-linter-config-files`, `assert-no-test-only-python-definition`, `assert-one-assert-per-pytest`, `copy-paste-source`, `copy-paste-tests`, `mypy-source`, `mypy-tests`, `pylint-source`, `pylint-tests` and `yamllint` carry no `needs:` and no `if:`, so they run on every push the workflow's `paths` start. `test-repo-libraries` is gated on nothing either, and it is first: `unit-tests` and `integration-tests` each name it in a `needs:` of their own and carry no `if` at all, so the nine modules under `lib/python/` are tested before either tier is attempted and a red one skips them both. `seeding` is `seed.yml`'s `reconciliation`, PUTting the git-authored inputs to the live API, so it names fifteen gates in its `if` — every job in the workflow but itself and the `e2e-tests` that follows it — in one flat `and` beside `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'`. `yamllint` and `assert-no-test-only-python-definition` joined that list on 2026-08-23, and two tests in `test/scripts/seed/pre_deployment/integration/test_contracts.py` now read the workflow and fail when a job is missing from the `needs:` or from the `if`. It used to carry a second arm reading `concluding-testing-unnecessary`, for the push that needed no testing at all; GitHub issue #73 deleted that gate, its sibling and the `determining-testing` job they both read, so every push that starts the workflow runs every tier, see [seed-tests-every-push](seed-tests-every-push.md).

### The edge that went

The edge that went is `test-repo-libraries: needs: static-analysis`, which cost the whole run a job's setup for checks nobody waits on, and with it `pre-deployment-integration-tests: needs: unit-tests`. A pre-deployment integration tier presumes the code is correct, not that anything exists yet, so `docs/tenets/tests/OVERVIEW.md` under "Nothing Is Trusted Before What It Presumes" lets it be attempted whenever — what its presumption fixes is what its result may be taken to mean, not when it may run. A green `unit-tests` in a run where `pylint-tests` went red is unestablished rather than a pass, and gating `reconciliation` on every check is what makes the workflow say so instead of the reader having to remember it: such a run deploys nothing, runs no post-deployment tier, and reports failure.

### The smaller instance in documentation.yml

`documentation.yml` is the smaller instance of the same shape and was the precedent for the fix rather than part of it: it already runs `markdownlint` and `yamllint` as separate jobs, and three checks still queue inside the markdown one.

### Two costs come with this

Two costs come with this. Each job pays its own runner start, checkout and install, so billed minutes go up while wall-clock time comes down. And there are eleven job blocks where there were eleven steps, in nine files, so a change to one check is a change in nine places — eight for `lint-yaml` and `validate-stack`, which `seed.yml` does not carry. `.github/workflows/api_common_routing.yml` had been linting `.github/workflows/api_common_storage.yml` rather than itself, which is the kind of defect that repetition hides.

### YAML linting in seed.yml is one job

YAML linting in `seed.yml` is one job, `yamllint`, and it is gated on nothing and gates nothing. It runs `yamllint --strict` over `.github/workflows/seed.yml`, `etc/daf.yml`, `etc/dow.yml`, `etc/f_35.yml`, `etc/minuteman.yml` and `etc/two_node.yml`, with the rules written into `--config-data` because `assert-no-linter-config-files` forbids a `.yamllint` on disk. Three jobs around it have been deleted: `determining-yamllint` and its two `concluding-yamllint-*` gates, which used to make a yamllint failure cascade into a skipped `seeding`, and `lint-yaml`, which ran the same `yamllint --strict` with the same rules over `.github/workflows/seed.yml` alone and was what `seeding` actually read. Its `Assert no inline directives` step went with them, so nothing now checks `.github/workflows/seed.yml` or `etc/` for a `# yamllint disable` comment — the `assert-no-inline-directives` job is pointed at `lib/python`, `scripts`, `test/scripts`, `test/lib/python/repo_utils` and `test/lib/python/test_http_doubles`, and neither path is in that list.
