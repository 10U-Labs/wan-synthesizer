"""Attach a non-PoP site to the backbone via synthetic local-fiber links.

A site that carries no fiber of its own (a forced installation, an off-net
operator seat) can still be seated on the carrier backbone by standing up a
co-located carrier-PoP *twin* at its coordinates and wiring that twin to the
nearest existing carrier PoPs with synthetic local-fiber links. The twin's name
matches the site, so an operator force-pin resolves onto it and the rest of the
synthesizer is none the wiser. A site without at least :data:`LOCAL_FIBER_MIN_LINKS`
carrier PoPs within :data:`LOCAL_FIBER_RADIUS_MILES` cannot be biconnected into the
backbone, so the twin is not built (the caller decides whether that is a skip or an
error). This module is the single home of that primitive, shared by the
installation and off-net seating layers.
