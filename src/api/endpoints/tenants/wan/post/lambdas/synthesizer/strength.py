"""Score a carrier PoP's strength: path diversity, compass spread, and straightness.

Backbone nodes are chosen for strength rather than mileage (the source mapbook has
no distances), so this scoring is the search's primary objective. It is isolated
here because it depends only on the precomputed graph context, not on the search
machinery that consumes it.

The protection term counts diverse paths rather than fiber segments. A city can have a
great many segments and funnel almost all of them through one or two upstream cities, in
which case the segments are one path wearing many coats; another can have few segments and
send every one of them somewhere separate. Measured over the merged carrier files, Los
Angeles has eighteen segments and carries six diverse paths while Cheyenne has eleven and
carries eight, so ranking the two by segments ranks them backwards.

    The bound counts paths from a site to *every other candidate site* that share no
    city along the way -- one max flow per site (see
    :func:`synthesizer.ceiling.independent_path_ceiling`). Counting to the candidates
    rather than to a chosen backbone is what makes it affordable: diversity is otherwise
    a property of the set, changing with every set the search considers, and a max flow
    inside a loop that enumerates millions of them is not something anyone can pay for.

    The bound is also honest about which way it errs. Any backbone the search settles on
    is a subset of these candidates, so it offers a path fewer places to end and no
    choice of set can exceed the bound. Adding fiber can only raise a maximum flow, so
    the bound stays true as the map grows -- the same reason the seed contract measures
    against the pins rather than against a synthesis nobody has built yet.

    The exact set-dependent measure is not replaced, only kept out of the hot loop: the
    coverage growth step still asks what a candidate's fiber can carry against the actual
    grown backbone (see :func:`synthesizer.coverage.candidate_mesh_ceiling`), because it
    weighs a handful of candidates rather than millions of sets.

    The tenant's backup path multiple is deliberately not applied here, and the reason is
    the same one that makes this bound affordable. It counts paths to every other candidate,
    so every city on the map is a peer a path may legitimately end at -- and a path that
    ends where it was going is not a detour, whatever its length. A crossing to a landing
    point is measured against the direct distance to that same landing point and comes out
    at one. So the bound has almost nothing to say at this scale: over the carrier files in
    ``data/`` it moves no candidate's score at all, while costing more than ten times what
    the count itself does. It bites where the peers are an actual backbone and the far side
    of an ocean is not among them, which is the growth step above and the mesh routing,
    and it is applied at both.
