    A node cannot owe more links than its fiber can independently carry, so the target is
    the smaller of the operator's degree and the node's computed ceiling (see
    :mod:`synthesizer.ceiling`). Where the ground is the constraint the target comes down
    on its own, and no exemption list has to name the node.

    Lowering it can only relax: ``min`` never raises a target above what was asked, so no
    synthesis that passes today is refused because of a number the tool derived. A node with
    no ceiling recorded owes the full degree, which covers both the caller with no substrate
    to hand and the node the substrate says nothing about.

    Which leaves the opposite risk, a ceiling below what the node could really hold, and
    with it a target lowered past a shortfall worth reporting. Unbounded, the ceiling could
    not do this: a set of links with pairwise disjoint failure cities is a feasible flow in
    the network it maximises over, so the flow can never come out under them. A ceiling
    measured against the operator's backup path multiple is a search among the paths that
    multiple allows rather than a maximum over all of them (see

    The number of diverse paths is the number a site gets, not a floor it may be carried

    So a node above its target is the exception rather than the norm, and every link taking
    it there is attributable to somebody else's requirement: a peer that needed this node
    to reach its own target, or an operator pin. The two grounds that once stood beside

    The number compared against is the one the tenant asked for, not the per-node target

    surplus would tell an
    operator they were given fiber they ordered themselves. What is reported is fiber
    nobody ordered, which is a different question from how much protection came of it --
