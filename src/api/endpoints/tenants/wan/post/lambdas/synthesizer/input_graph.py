"""The synthesizer's input-graph types and primitive helpers.

The vertex/edge dataclasses and geographic helpers that describe the graph the
synthesizer syntheses against: a :class:`Vertex` is an access site, cloud region, or
carrier PoP; a :class:`PhysicalEdge` is fiber between two PoPs.
:mod:`synthesizer.codec` builds these from the stored JSON rows. The
synthesizer's own synthesis vocabulary -- tiers, tuning, validation -- lives in
