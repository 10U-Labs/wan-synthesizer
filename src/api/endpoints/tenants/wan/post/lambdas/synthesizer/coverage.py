"""Grow the backbone past its strength-chosen base until demand is close enough.

The search picks the strongest backbone it can at the floor. That backbone answers a
question about fiber, not about where anybody actually is, so some demand may still sit
farther from it than the operator allows. This module adds nodes until that is no longer
true, and decides which node to add.

Two questions decide a round and they are asked in that order: coverage says which
candidates are admissible, and fiber says which of those is worth seating. Both are written
up where they are answered, in :func:`grow_backbone_for_coverage` and
:func:`best_coverage_candidate`. What the delivered synthesis did about the target is
reported by :func:`coverage_report`, since growth can stop without having met it.

    """Add backbone nodes beyond the strength-chosen base until demand is close enough.

    While some demand site the target applies to is farther than
    ``backbone_coverage_target_miles`` from every selected backbone node, seat one more
    candidate and rebuild the synthesis around it. Extra nodes are thus coverage-driven:
    strength still chooses the base backbone, and the operator's coverage target is a
    constraint on how far the backbone may leave demand, not a mileage cost minimized over
    candidate sets. Growth stops once every non-exempt demand site is within target, the
    backbone reaches ``max_backbone_count``, no remaining candidate leaves any site nearer
    than the synthesis already does, or the candidates are exhausted. Only the first of those
    is success, which is why :func:`coverage_report` measures what came out.

    Two questions decide a round and they are asked in that order. Which candidates are
    admissible is a coverage question, and one measure has to answer it in all three places
    -- the stop test, the scoring and the progress filter -- or the loop argues with itself.
    That measure is the haul profile over the sites the target applies to: every one of
    their hauls, worst first, compared position by position. Were candidates scored by the
    summed haul over every site instead, a round could be won by a node that shortens many
    sites already inside the target while leaving the far one where it was, and the exempt
    sites, exempt precisely because they are far from everything, would contribute the
    largest terms to that sum and so have the most say in a choice they were lifted out of.
    The round would spend a node and come round again with the gap still open.

    Judging progress on the worst haul alone was the same error read the other way. It
    asks whether the worst number on the board moved rather than whether a hub helped a
    site, and the two part company the moment a second site is queued just behind the
    first: seating the hub that rescues the leader promotes the runner-up, the board barely
    moves, and the round reports that nothing improved while a site went from five hundred
    miles of haul to fifty. Two sites at exactly equal haul deadlock such a test at any
    tolerance, which is why there is no tolerance to tune here and the profiles are simply
    compared. Growth is bounded regardless: each round spends a candidate, and the stop
    test above ends it as soon as the target is met.

    Which of the admissible candidates to seat is not a coverage question at all, and
    answering it with distance was the second half of the same mistake. Among candidates
    that satisfy the target, the best-connected one is seated (see
    :func:`best_coverage_candidate`), because a hub that meets the distance requirement and
    then cannot hold the links a backbone node owes has not solved anything.

    The synthesis itself is drawn once, at the end, over whatever the rounds settled on. Every
    round asks its questions of the backbone's ids -- where the sites are, which candidates
    are admissible, which is best connected -- and none of them reads a drawn synthesis, so
    drawing one per round was drawing a synthesis nobody looked at. It cost little while the
    paths were laid a pair at a time; the fiber for a whole synthesis is now chosen at once
    (see :mod:`synthesizer.survivable`), which is the expensive step of a build, and a
    backbone that grows from three seats to thirty-four would have paid it thirty-one times
    over.

    The seats it starts from come in as ids rather than as a synthesis for the same reason.
    Choosing the fiber for a base backbone and then seating one more node past it drew a
    whole synthesis nobody read, which cost DOW 234 of its 438 seconds and put that tenant
    past the fifteen minutes AWS allows a Lambda (GitHub issue #72). Growth that seats
    nothing draws the same one synthesis over the same seats, so there is no shorter path
    through here to keep.
