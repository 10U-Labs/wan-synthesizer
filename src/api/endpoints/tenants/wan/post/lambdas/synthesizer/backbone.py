"""Draw the backbone's paths over the fiber the whole synthesis was chosen with.

Every backbone node owes its tenant a number of ways out that no one city's loss takes two
of, and an operator pays for every path they hold. So the synthesis owes them the paths they
asked for and nothing besides. This module produces that list of paths, and it does it in
two steps: the fiber to buy is chosen for the whole synthesis at once by
:mod:`synthesizer.survivable`, and the paths are then read off that fiber, one site at a
time, as the ways out each site actually holds over it.

Splitting it that way is the point. The four passes that stood here until GitHub issue #60
decided one pair of sites at a time -- which pairs to join, which fiber each pair's path
took, where to put a second path back, how to relieve a city carrying the whole network --
and no pass ever reconsidered what an earlier one had settled. Each decision was defensible
when it was taken, and together they left 54 of the 192 published paths buying nobody a way
out: 23,917 of the 83,927 fiber miles six tenants were paying for then, 28 per cent of it,
on paths that could all be taken out at once without costing a single site a way out
or leaving one city carrying the network. The paths came from every pass, so no one pass was
the defect; the sequence was.

What is left after the choice is ordinary reading. A site's ways out over the fiber the
synthesis bought are the fewest-mile set of paths out of it that no one city's loss takes two
of, which is what :func:`synthesizer.ceiling.independent_paths` already computes, and the
tenant's number says how many of them are drawn. A path and its reverse are the same fiber
and are drawn once. An operator's pin is honoured whatever the choice said. And a path no
site needs is dropped, because the whole complaint in issue #60 is paths nobody needs.

One thing the reading cannot give a tenant is the thing it is really buying. Two ways out of
every site is bought so that the backbone stays in one piece when a city goes dark, and a
site can hold both of its own ways out while the cities its peers depend on are the ones that
fail: three of the five tenants asking for two published a network that some one city's loss
broke in two (GitHub issue #112). So the paths are asked that question once they are read
off the fiber, and every city whose loss would split them is given one more path round it
(see :func:`_relieved`). That is a requirement over the whole network rather than a fifth
pass over pairs -- it is asked once, of the finished list, and the paths it adds are prunable
like any other.
