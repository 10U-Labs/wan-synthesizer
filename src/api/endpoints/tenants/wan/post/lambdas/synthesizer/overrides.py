"""Resolve operator role pins into search role overrides.

The synthesizer's search consumes a :class:`~synthesizer.model.RoleOverrides`
describing which PoPs are forced backbone nodes, which are barred from the
backbone, and how the operator's forced edges resolve to ids. This module builds
that object from the operator's force-pins (resolved by name), gated by the set of
data-center cities a colocation provider operates in. It runs before the search
and never calls back into it.
