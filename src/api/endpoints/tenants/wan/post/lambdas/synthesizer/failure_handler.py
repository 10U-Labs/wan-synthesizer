"""Failure handler: record a tenant's WAN as ``fail`` when the synthesizer dies.

The async ``on_failure`` destination for the synthesizer Lambda. AWS delivers the failed
invocation's event here only when the synthesizer did NOT return normally -- a wall-clock
timeout, an out-of-memory kill, or an unhandled crash -- none of which run the
synthesizer's own ``except`` block (a caught error is a normal return and never reaches
this handler). Read the tenant from the original request payload and write the terminal
``fail`` status the dispatcher's GET serves as 422, so a build can never stay stuck on
``synthesizing`` forever.
