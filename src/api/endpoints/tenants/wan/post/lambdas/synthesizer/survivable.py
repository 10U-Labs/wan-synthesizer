"""Choose the fiber a whole backbone is built from at once, and say how short it could be.

A tenant asks for a number of ways out of every backbone node that no one city's loss
takes two of. Which segments of the carrier's fiber to select so that every node has them is
one question about the whole synthesis, and this module answers it as one question rather
than as a sequence of decisions about one pair of sites at a time. Deciding a pair at a
time is what left 54 of the 192 published paths gaining nobody a way out, 23,917 miles of
fiber that the six tenants declared then paid for every month and got nothing for (GitHub
issue #60): each decision was defensible when it was taken and none was ever revisited.

Every segment is either in the answer or out of it, and deciding them that way has no fast
exact method. Choosing the fewest-mile set of fiber segments in which every pair of
backbone nodes is joined by as many paths sharing no city as the tenant asked for is the
survivable network synthesis problem, and it is NP-hard -- the case where every requirement
is two contains Hamiltonian cycle -- so nothing that answers it in whole segments finishes
on a national map. What this module does instead is let the solver answer in fractions,
where the same question is a linear program and comes back in milliseconds, and then
convert that answer to whole segments a few at a time: hold each segment anywhere between
none of it and all of it, take the fewest miles that meet every requirement, and select
outright every segment the answer holds at half or more. Repeat over what is still unmet.

Answering in fractions is what earns the guarantee, and the guarantee is the reason for the
detour. Jain's result says a fewest-miles fractional answer always holds some segment at
half or more, so every round selects something and the search always ends; and for element
connectivity -- paths sharing no fiber segment and no city between their two ends -- what it
ends with runs at most twice the fewest miles any synthesis could have run (Fleischer, Jain
and Williamson 2006, on the half-integrality of Jain 2001). A rule that read the map
directly and added segments by eye would be quicker to write and could be beaten by any
margin at all; this one cannot be beaten by more than double.

The relaxation is where the second half of the answer comes from. No synthesis can run fewer
miles than a program whose every row is a requirement that synthesis has to meet, so the
program's own answer is a floor under the whole problem. It is published beside the synthesis
as ``backbone_lower_bound_miles``, because a claim that a synthesis is close to the shortest
one there is means nothing until the shortest one there is has a number.

What a site can be given is what one carrier can sell it, and no further than the operator
would order. A path is ordered from one company end to end and paid for every month, so two
ways out of a site whose halves belong to different companies are one way out and not two;
and a path running further from the straight line than the tenant's
``backbone.max_backup_path_multiple`` allows is one nobody orders at all. Every requirement
below is therefore written over one carrier's own fiber, cut to the segments a path from
that site to those peers could run on inside that bound, and the tenant's number is spread
over the carriers by :func:`synthesizer.ceiling.ways_out_by_carrier` -- the same proof
:func:`synthesizer.stages.finalize` later holds the finished synthesis to.

Writing them over the whole map instead is what made the fiber chosen here beside the
point. The answer met requirements with ways out nobody sells and detours nobody would
order, ``synthesizer.backbone._ways_out_of`` then drew 29 of the 37 backbone seats over the
carriers' whole fiber rather than over what was selected, and the floor published beside the
synthesis was a floor for a network no operator could have built: DoW ran 9,294.692 miles
against 7,361.252 (GitHub issue #113). The narrower half of the same defect had already
been answered for the floor alone by lowering each requirement to a ceiling, after ***REMOVED***
published 8,844.892 miles against a floor of 9,141.641 it had already beaten (GitHub issue
#111).

Two requirements are written down rather than one, and they are not the same requirement.
Element connectivity between every pair of backbone nodes is the one the bound above is
proved for, and it treats the sites at a path's two ends as never failing. What this
repository actually asks of a site is narrower: ``synthesizer.validation.
diverse_path_count`` charges a way out for the peer it ends at, so two ways out of a site
that both run through one peer are one way out rather than two. That requirement is
written down as well, once per site, and the fiber has to meet both. Writing only the
first would let the program select a synthesis where every way out of a site runs through one
its peers, which the tenant did not ask for and validation would refuse.

Splitting the rows by carrier costs the bound nothing. A synthesis meeting rows that each
name one company is a synthesis meeting the same rows written over everybody's fiber at
once, so the relaxation's answer is still below anything buildable and
``backbone_lower_bound_miles`` is still a floor. What changes is which network it is a
floor for: the one the tenant is handed, rather than one nobody could have ordered.

    rows so far, search each requirement over the shares that came back, add what that
    found, and solve again. It ends when the answer meets every requirement there is and
    not only the ones on paper, which is what its caller then selects fiber on the strength of.

    Stopping anywhere short of that selects fiber to meet requirements the answer was never
    held to. A cap of 24 passes used to stand here, and every one of the six tenants
    declared then needed hundreds -- 645 for DAF, 1,382 for AFGSC, which ``etc/`` no longer

    missed three requirements, leaving it holding 17 fiber segments and 871.542 miles more
    than a synthesis meeting the same requirements needs (GitHub issue #63).

    The search ends of its own accord in two ways and both are needed. A pass that finds no
    shortfall has met everything. A pass that finds only separations already written down
    has nothing left to tell the program, so solving again would return the same answer for
