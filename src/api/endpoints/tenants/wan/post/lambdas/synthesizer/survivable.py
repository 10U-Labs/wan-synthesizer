"""Choose the fiber a whole backbone is built from at once, and say how short it could be.

A tenant asks for a number of ways out of every backbone node that no one city's loss
takes two of. Which segments of the carrier's fiber to buy so that every node has them is
one question about the whole synthesis, and this module answers it as one question rather
than as a sequence of decisions about one pair of sites at a time. Deciding a pair at a
time is what left 54 of the 192 published paths buying nobody a way out, 23,917 miles of
fiber that six tenants pay for every month and get nothing for (GitHub issue #60): each
decision was defensible when it was taken and none of them was ever revisited.

The problem has a name. Choosing the fewest-mile set of fiber segments in which every pair
of backbone nodes is joined by as many paths sharing no city as the tenant asked for is
the survivable network synthesis problem, and it is NP-hard -- the case where every
requirement is two contains Hamiltonian cycle -- so no exact method finishes on a national
map. What is available is a method with a proven limit on how far past the ideal it can
land, by iterative rounding of the linear-programming relaxation: hold each segment
anywhere between none of it and all of it, buy the fewest miles that meet every
requirement, and take the segments the answer holds at half or more as bought outright
(Fleischer, Jain and Williamson 2006, on the half-integrality of Jain 2001). Repeat over
what is still unmet. For element connectivity -- paths sharing no fiber segment and no
city between their two ends -- that lands within twice the fewest miles any synthesis could
have run.

The relaxation is where the second half of the answer comes from. No synthesis can run fewer
miles than a program whose every row is a requirement that synthesis has to meet, so the
program's own answer is a floor under the whole problem. It is published beside the synthesis
as ``backbone_lower_bound_miles``, because a claim that a synthesis is close to the shortest
one there is means nothing until the shortest one there is has a number.

Two requirements are written down rather than one, and they are not the same requirement.
Element connectivity between every pair of backbone nodes is the one the bound above is
proved for, and it treats the sites at a path's two ends as never failing. What this
repository actually asks of a site is narrower: ``synthesizer.validation.
diverse_path_count`` charges a way out for the peer it ends at, so two ways out of a site
that both run through one peer are one way out rather than two. That requirement is
written down as well, once per site, and the fiber has to meet both. Writing only the
first would let the program buy a synthesis where every way out of a site runs through one of
its peers, which the tenant did not ask for and validation would refuse.
