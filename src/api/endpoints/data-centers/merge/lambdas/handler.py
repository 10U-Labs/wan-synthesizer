"""Data-centers merge endpoint: union every provider's facilities into one site set.

    POST /wan-graph-synthesizer/data-centers/merge -> (re)build the union
    GET  /wan-graph-synthesizer/data-centers/merge -> the union's facilities

The union is just every provider's facility points gathered together, each row tagged
with the provider it came from (taken from its endpoint path). The synthesizer reads this
one file to learn the data-center cities that gate which carrier PoPs may serve as
backbone nodes. Facilities carry no fiber, so there are no links to merge -- the union is
a single collection, so its one resource both builds (POST) and serves (GET). Stays a
self-contained (stdlib + boto3) single-file Lambda.
