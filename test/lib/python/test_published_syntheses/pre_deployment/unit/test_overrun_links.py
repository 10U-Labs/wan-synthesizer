"""Unit tests for the published links drawn further than their tenant's bound allows.

Three of the four cases below are links the helper discards without recording that it
did, and no published network will ever contain one: a real synthesis names no node outside
its own backbone, joins no node to itself, and seats no two nodes at one set of
coordinates. They are tested here because a helper that discarded every link would return
the empty list a sound network returns, and the assertion that stands on it could not tell
the two apart.

The two nodes sit a degree of longitude apart at forty degrees north, which is 52.9 miles
of great circle, and the tenant allows three times the direct distance. The sinuosity
allowance doubles that, so a link between them is over-long past 317 miles.
