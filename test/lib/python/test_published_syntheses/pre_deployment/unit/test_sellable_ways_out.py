"""Unit tests for how many ways out of a city its carriers could be asked to quote.

An operator orders a path from one company and pays that company for it every month, so a
way out of a site assembled from two companies' fiber is not a product anybody sells
(GitHub issue #106). The helper asks each carrier on its own over its own fiber and adds
the answers, which is what an operator really does: one path from each of several
companies rather than one path from none of them.

What it is for is holding a published ceiling against a source outside the build that
produced it. A build that counted a site's ways out over everybody's fiber at once would
credit it with ways out nobody sells, and a floor priced for those sits above the fiber the
network beside it actually ordered -- ***REMOVED*** published 8,844.892 miles against a floor of
9,141.641 it had already beaten (GitHub issue #111). Boston, MA is the shape that did it,
and the first fixture below is Boston: fiber in three directions, three owners, and only
one of them reaching anywhere the tenant pins.

The number is bounded from above rather than measured exactly, on purpose. Two carriers'
answers may cross the same city, and a city carrying two ways out is one way out the moment
it goes, so what an operator could really hold is at most this. Erring high leaves a sound
ceiling passing and erring low would fail a healthy network, which is the worse of the two.
