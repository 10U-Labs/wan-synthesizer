"""Unit tests for reading one tenant's published network from the API.

The service is replaced by a stand-in that answers each path from a canned document, so
what is held to account here is what the reader asks for and what it makes of the answers,
with no deployment and no network involved. The three cases are the three answers the WAN
endpoint gives: a build that has published, a build still running, and a build that failed,
which the endpoint reports by refusing the request with a 422 whose body says so.
