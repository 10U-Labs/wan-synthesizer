"""The stub API answers a real request and records what it was sent.

``scripts/seed.py`` is driven as a subprocess in the tier that owns this file, and a
subprocess cannot be handed an in-process double: it opens a socket and speaks HTTP. The
stub is the far end of that socket. It is the only thing standing between those tests and
a live API, so what it records is the whole of what they know about what seed delivered.

This is where the module stops being exercisable by literals. Two real units are put
against each other -- a client speaking HTTP and the server reading it -- and nothing
outside the process is reached: the server is opened by the test on a loopback port the
operating system picks, and closed again on the way out.
