"""Unit tests for the stand-in clients a write-side case hands a handler.

A storing endpoint reaches two services: the store it writes into and Lambda, which it
invokes when a build is meant to start. Both are replaced here by one call, so a test can
read the store afterwards and can say whether anything was invoked.

The second is the assertion that would fail quietly. "A PUT starts no build" is judged on
an empty list of invocations, and a stand-in that never recorded one produces that empty
list whatever the handler did.
