"""The single-resource contract, exercised as the machinery it is.

One endpoint stores a fixed object rather than a resource per id, so a request names the
collection in its path and nothing else. Its read side, its 404s and its delete are all
addressed differently from the id-keyed endpoints, which is why they are a contract of
their own rather than a case inside the other one.

It has exactly one consumer, so nothing else would ever run it: a change here that broke
it would be reported against the providers endpoint, in the providers workflow, on
whichever push next touched that endpoint.
