"""Unit tests for loading an endpoint's handler the way its Lambda runs it.

Seven test files drive a deployed handler through this call, and it settles three things
before the first assertion is made: which file is loaded, what the environment says while
it runs, and whether the client the previous case cached is still in place. The third is
the one that fails silently -- a handler holding a client from an earlier case answers
from that case's store, so a test passes on data it never wrote.
