"""Unit tests for the stand-in S3 client every handler's unit tests store through.

The handlers keep the whole program's state in one bucket, so their unit tests need
something that behaves like that bucket: a read serves what a write left, a read of a key
nobody wrote raises what the real client raises, and a listing says which keys are there.
This double is that bucket for five test files.

A double that answers success to everything is the failure worth spelling out. A handler
that never wrote what it claimed to write passes every assertion made about its response,
because the only witness to the write is the double, and the run names nothing.
