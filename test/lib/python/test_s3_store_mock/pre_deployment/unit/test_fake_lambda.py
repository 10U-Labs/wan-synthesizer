"""Unit tests for the stand-in Lambda client that records each invocation.

One endpoint starting another is the shape the write endpoints are held to: a PUT stores
a collection and invokes nothing, and a POST is what starts a build. Both readings rest
on this list, and a double that dropped an invocation would report a write endpoint as
well behaved precisely when it had started a build nobody asked for.
