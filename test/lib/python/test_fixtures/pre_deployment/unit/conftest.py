"""The client fixtures under test, declared here so this tier can ask for them.

A fixture is only exercised by being requested, and pytest finds the ones a directory may
request through its ``conftest.py``. Every tier that uses these declares them the same
way; this one differs only in that the fixtures are the subject rather than the setup.
