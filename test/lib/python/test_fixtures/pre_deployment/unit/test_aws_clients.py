"""Unit tests for the boto3 clients every tier that talks to AWS is handed.

Fifty-one test files reach the platform through these fixtures, and each one decides two
things a test can never see for itself: which service is asked, and which region it is
asked in. A client built for the wrong region reaches a real account, is answered
truthfully, and reports every resource in it absent -- so the run names the resource, the
deployment that owns it, and never the fixture.

``boto3.client`` is replaced here by something that reports what it was asked to build,
so what is under test is the asking rather than anything AWS would answer.
