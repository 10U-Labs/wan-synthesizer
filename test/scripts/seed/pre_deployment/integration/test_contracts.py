    ``cities`` picks which of a tenant's cities to measure, which is the only thing the two
    contracts below differ in: one asks about the cities a tenant excuses, the other about
    the cities it pins.

    The bound counts paths from the city to the tenant's pinned backbone cities that share
    no city on the way, over the merged carrier substrate. It is a floor rather than the
    real ceiling for two reasons, and both point the same way: the real run seats backbone
    nodes beyond the pins, which gives paths more distinct places to end, and it fabricates
    on-net points and seats off-net ones, which adds fiber segments. Neither can lower a maximum
    flow, so the real ceiling is at least what this returns.

    A city the carrier files hold no point for is left out, since there is no graph to
    measure it on and a silent zero would read as a proven limit.

    A city with no other pin to path to at all is left out for the same reason: every path
    counted here ends at one of the tenant's pins, so a city that is the only pin leaves a
    path out of it nowhere to go and the bound reads zero however much fiber leaves the
    city. That is a fact about the config rather than about the ground. Two-Node was in that
    position while it pinned Ashburn, VA alone, and pinning Salt Lake City, UT beside it
    brought both cities back into the count.

    Having fewer pins than the number asked for is no longer a reason to leave a city out.
    A peer may carry more than one path where the tenant's own seats leave its sites too
    few peers to reach (see ``synthesizer.ceiling.paths_per_peer``), so the tenant's number
    and its seat cap are both passed in and a two-seat tenant asking for two paths is
    measured on whether its fiber joins the two cities two ways rather than skipped for
    having pinned only two. Two-Node is that tenant, and the seat cap is what the build
    reads, so measuring without it would hold a city to a bound the synthesis never applies.

    What keeps a pin honest while it is the only one is the synthesizer itself, which seats
    a pin only where the carrier graph gives it two links (``compute_eligible_backbone_ids``)
    and refuses one sitting in a fiber pocket too small for the backbone it was asked for
    (``forced_backbone_resilience_error``).

    The tenant's own backup path multiple is applied, because the real run applies it: a
    ceiling measured over fiber the synthesis may not use is not a floor under the real one
    but a number above it, and a tenant could clear this contract on paths its build would
    refuse. Adding pins can only admit more fiber segments, since a segment is withheld only when no
    peer at all can reach it inside its budget, so the bound stays a floor under the real
    ceiling exactly as before.

    """No tenant caps its backbone below the seats its own coverage target would need.

    A tenant states two things that have to agree, and neither file settles it alone: the
    config sets the target and the seat cap, and only the carrier maps say how many points
    it takes to bring every site inside that distance. Where the cap is the smaller of the
    two the coverage pass runs out of seats before it runs out of target, and the synthesis it
    publishes misses by whatever the pins happened to leave. Nothing objects, because both
    numbers are legal on their own and the synthesis is the honest answer to the pair.

    Minuteman was the tenant that failed this. It pinned six cities into a backbone capped
    at six and asked for 400 miles, so the coverage pass began with no seat to spend and
    ended 484 miles out, while the greedy cover says nine seats would have done it and no
    place it serves is more than 37.7 miles from some carrier point. Its target was raised
    to what the six pinned cities deliver rather than its cap being raised to the target.
