"""The published networks seed asked for, paired with what each tenant's config demands.

``delivered_designs`` reads what the synthesizer published for every tenant the roster in
``etc/`` declares. The roster is the list of tenants and ``seed`` supplies the
file-stem-to-tenant-id rule, so a tenant added to git is one this tier starts asking about
with no edit here. The reading itself is ``test_published_designs.published_design``, which
asks the API for each tenant's build state and its five published collections; nothing here
opens the store the synthesizer writes to. Each entry is a plain mapping of ten keys:
``tenant``, the ``target_miles``, ``max_backup_path_multiple``, ``seat_cap`` and pinned ``forced``
cities the config sets, the ``status`` document the GET passes through, and the published
``backbone``, ``demand``, ``links`` and ``edges`` collections that status can be measured
against. A tenant whose build is not ``success`` has no network to read and carries all
four empty.
