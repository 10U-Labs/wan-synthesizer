"""Unit tests for the paths a backbone is drawn with over the fiber it was chosen with.

``synthesizer.backbone`` no longer decides anything one pair of sites at a time. The fiber
is chosen for the whole synthesis at once by ``synthesizer.survivable``, each site's ways out
are read off that fiber, and every path nobody needs is taken back out. So the cases here
are about the finished list of paths rather than about the order four passes ran in: which
pairs ended up joined, which fiber each path took, and which paths were dropped again.

Two graphs carry almost all of it. The square is four sites on a ring of hundred-mile
segments with two chords at two hundred and fifty, so the only synthesis that gives every site
two ways out is the ring itself and both the count and the mileage are forced. The
shared-egress graph is the shape GitHub issue #60 is about: the fewest-mile way from ``hub``
to ``q`` runs through ``m``, which is a city ``hub`` already stands on to reach ``p``, and a
slightly longer way through ``n`` does not. A synthesis that decides one pair at a time takes
the shorter way and leaves ``hub`` with one way out; a synthesis that chooses the whole thing
at once takes the longer one.
