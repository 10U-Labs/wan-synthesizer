"""Unit tests for operator-forced paths: resolution and routing wiring.

These pin the mechanism -- names resolve to id-typed links against the seated tiers,
and the synthesizer honors them -- rather than any particular city pin. Which tier a
written link acts on is the list it sits in, so each case names the list rather than a
type on the entry.
