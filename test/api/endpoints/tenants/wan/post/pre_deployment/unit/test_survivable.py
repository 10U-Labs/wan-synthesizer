"""Unit tests for choosing the fiber a whole backbone is built from in one decision.

What this module settles is which of the carrier's fiber segments a tenant's synthesis stands
on, so every graph here is shaped to force one answer rather than to leave two syntheses of
equal mileage for a solver to pick between. A four-site ring is the clearest of them: every
site is owed two ways out, each site has exactly two segments, and the only synthesis meeting
that is the whole ring, whose mileage is the ring's own. The rest are that ring with one
part changed -- a long chord nothing needs, a chain that leaves a site behind one city, two
triangles held apart by a single segment, a pair with two ways round it, and that pair
again with the two halves of one way round belonging to different carriers -- so that each
test turns on one part of the choice and the fixture beside it says which.

Only the last of them writes an owner on any fiber, and it is the one graph here that can
tell what a site can be sold from what its fiber alone could carry. A path is ordered from
one carrier end to end, so a way round assembled from two owners is a way round nobody
quotes; every other fixture here names no carrier, and fiber naming no carrier is fiber
every carrier's path may run over, so the two counts agree on all of them by construction
(GitHub issue #111).

One graph here is not shaped by hand, and it is the last. The choice is made by writing a
requirement down as an answer violates it and solving again, and every graph above settles
in a pass or two, so none of them can tell a search that finished from one that was cut off
part-way. Twelve cities of carrier fiber with five backbone seats takes 26 passes, which is
what makes it the fixture that notices (GitHub issue #63).

The floor published with the choice is asserted as a number only where the graph forces the
number, and as an inequality over every fixture at the end. No synthesis meeting the same
requirements can run fewer miles than the floor, and a floor above the fiber actually bought
would be a claim the synthesis cannot be as short as it already is.
