"""Unit tests for the synthesizer Lambda handler.

The heavy design pipeline is stubbed (it is exercised by the synthesizer engine tests);
these tests cover the handler's own orchestration and S3 I/O: it reads the tenant from
the invoke event, moves the status to ``building``, and publishes ``ready``/``failed``.
