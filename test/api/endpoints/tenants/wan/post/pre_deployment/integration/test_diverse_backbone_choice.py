"""Integration test: which sites a whole synthesis settles on when the measures disagree.

The unit tier can show that the score ranks a well-connected site above one with more fiber.
It cannot show that the ranking survives the pipeline -- feasibility, the city-survival
gate, the last-mile tie-break and the coverage growth all sit between a score and a
backbone, and any of them could put the site back. So the same graph is run through the
whole synthesis here and the backbone is asserted rather than the score.

The graph is the one fixture where fiber segment count and path diversity rank sites
differently (see ``fixtures.FUNNEL_EDGES``). Two sites have five segments each that converge
on the same two upstream cities, so each carries two paths that fail independently; one
site has three segments leaving to three separate cities and carries three. Ranked by segments
the two funnels are the strongest pair and the spread site is left out; ranked by
diversity the spread site is seated. Two seats are all the synthesis gets, so the two
rankings cannot both be satisfied and the backbone says which one ran.
