"""Integration test: how many fiber miles a whole synthesis orders, and how few it could have.

A synthesis grows by paths that are each defensible on their own. That is how 54 of the 192
published paths came to buy nobody a way out, 23,917 miles of fiber six tenants were paying
for then and got nothing for (GitHub issue #60): every one of them was the shortest way
to join the pair it joined, or the shortest way round a city carrying the network, and no
assertion anywhere asked what the synthesis cost in total. A total is the only assertion that
notices that, so this file makes one, over a graph whose answer can be worked out by hand.

The graph is four sites on a ring of hundred-mile segments with the two chords priced at two
hundred and fifty. Every site is bought two ways out and has three fiber directions to find
them in, so the ring is the answer and the chords are what make it an answer rather than the
only synthesis there is. Four sites needing two ways out apiece come to eight ends, and a
segment carries two, so no synthesis holds fewer than four segments; the four shortest are the
ring, at four hundred miles.

The ring cannot reach every way this goes wrong, because its answer is settled by the first
solve the search runs. ``synthesizer.survivable`` writes its requirements down as an answer
violates them, and a limit of 24 passes on that used to stand in the module: on a graph
answered in one pass a limit of any size is invisible, and on the six real maps there were
then, which needed between 645 and 1,382 passes, it stopped every search early and bought
fiber on an answer that still missed requirements (GitHub issue #63). So a second graph runs
here, twelve cities of carrier fiber with five backbone seats, whose search takes 26 passes.
Left to finish it delivers the 159 miles of its own floor; stopped at 24 it delivered 176.

The second assertion is the guarantee the fiber choice carries, stated rather than assumed.
``synthesizer.survivable`` chooses the fiber by iterative rounding of a linear-programming
relaxation, and publishes that relaxation's own answer as the floor under the whole problem
-- no synthesis meeting the same requirements runs fewer miles than that. The synthesis it
produces is at most twice the floor. An implementation that has lost the guarantee through a
defect fails here, which is a thing an approximation cannot otherwise report about itself.

A third graph carries the owners. Neither of the two above says who has fiber where, and a
segment naming no carrier is one every carrier's path may run over, so on both of them what
a site can be sold and what its fiber alone could carry are the same number by construction.
The third is a ring of four cities, two of them seats, whose way round through ``q`` is half
Zayo's and half Lumen's -- a way round nobody quotes, since a path is ordered from one
carrier end to end. Each seat therefore holds one way out and not the two the ring's shape
suggests, and a floor priced for two would sit above the fiber the synthesis actually
orders. That is what ***REMOVED*** published: 8,844.892 miles ordered against a floor of 9,141.641
it had already beaten, because Boston, MA was priced for a second way out no carrier sells
(GitHub issue #111).
