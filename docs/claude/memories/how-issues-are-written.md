# How issues are written

An issue about the program has six sections, in this order, and every issue about the program has all six even when a section is short.

- **Problem** — what is wrong, stated as a fact about the code with the evidence for it.
- **Why Unit Tests Did Not Catch It** — the specific assertions that passed, and why they could not have failed.
- **Why Integration Tests Did Not Catch It** — the same, for the tier that checks two units agreeing.
- **Why E2E Tests Did Not Catch It** — the same, for the tier that makes a caller's journey against the deployed program and judges it on what the caller receives.
- **Which Unit, Integration, or E2E regression tests would prevent this from happening again?** — the tests to write, each named by the tier it belongs to and the assertion it makes.
- **Proposed Solution** — the one change to make.

An issue about anything else has two sections, **Problem** and **Proposed Solution**, and owes no tests at all.

One change, not a choice between two. Whoever picks the issue up is free to do something else, but they should not have to decide anything before they can start, so a fork found while drafting is asked about and settled before the issue is filed — see [an-issue-states-one-solution](an-issue-states-one-solution.md).

The closing section is called "Proposed Solution" and not "Solution". It is what the issue proposes, and whoever picks the issue up is free to do something else; the name says so before they have read a word of it. Issues #35 and #37 through #55 were all written with `## Solution` while the reminder at :09 of `.claude/skills/autopilot/SKILL.md` asked for `Proposed Solution`, and this file was the one that was wrong. The seven open on 2026-08-02 — #45, #46, #47, #49, #52, #53 and #56 — were rewritten that day and carry `## Proposed Solution`. Fourteen closed ones still carry `## Solution` and stay as they are: a closed issue is a record of what was written, and nobody is going to act on its heading.

The program is the code a test tier can run: `src/`, `lib/python/`, `scripts/`, and the OpenTofu under `lib/` that the post-deployment tier checks once it is applied. The four test sections are about the program and are written only for it. A defect there got past tiers that exist and could have failed, and naming which assertion let it through is what turns one bug report into a gap in the suite that can be closed.

The tenant configs under `etc/`, the PoPs and fiber segments under `data/`, the workflow files under `.github/workflows/` and the documentation are not the program. No tier runs them. A test written against one of them opens the file, reads a value back and asserts the value it just read, so it cannot fail for a reason worth knowing and it fails for reasons that are not: it goes red every time somebody adds a tenant or renames a step. Do not write the four sections for such an issue, and do not write the test the fourth section would have asked for. Issue #37, a defect in three workflow files, spent its closing paragraph arguing why no coverage came with it, and an earlier draft of it had asked for two contract tests before they were dropped; under this rule neither the tests nor the argument would have been written.

`test/` falls on both sides, and the split is not the directory. The machinery a tier runs on is program code and gets six sections: the fixtures, the helpers, the doubles, anything that computes a value the assertions then rest on. It can be wrong in a way that makes a whole layer report the wrong answer, and a unit tier can usually reach it, so asking which assertion should have failed has a real answer. The shared machinery is inside the program by its location already — `lib/python/test_fixtures/`, `test_http_doubles/`, `test_s3_store_mock/` and their siblings all sit under `lib/python/` — and what matters is that machinery does not stop being machinery when it sits in a `conftest.py` under `test/` instead. Issue #47 is the worked example: a settle rule inside a conftest returned early, a whole post-deployment layer measured a network built before the config it was credited against, and the missing unit assertion over that rule was a real finding.

The assertions themselves are the other side. A test that checks the wrong thing, checks nothing, or checks a value it just read is a defect in the coverage rather than in the program, and it gets two sections. Asking why the unit tests did not catch a defective unit test answers itself.

The line is what the defect is in, not what the fix touches. A change to the program that also edits a config file is a program issue and gets all six. A change confined to config, PoPs, fiber segments or workflows is not, however much program behaviour it moves.

Within a program issue, answer each of the three backward-looking sections honestly, including when the honest answer is that the tier does not exist for that part of the program, or that the tier is the wrong home for the question and something else should have caught it. That answer is the finding, not a reason to leave the section out.

The regression section is those three read forwards, and it is where the coverage owed is named. Each entry says which tier the test sits in, what it sets up, and what it asserts, so that the test can be written from the issue without rediscovering the defect. It is a separate section from the solution because a fix and the test that would have caught it are separate pieces of work, and an issue that folds the second into the last paragraph of the first tends to ship without it.

Write prose in simple, plain, ordinary English. Short sentences, no hedging, no jargon from computer science where a plain word will do. Assume a network engineer is reading, not a graph theorist. One fact to a sentence. Where a section has to say why some part of the program exists at all, it takes the shape in [lead-with-what-it-is-for](lead-with-what-it-is-for.md): what the program is doing at that moment, then what that step requires, then the thing about those facts that forces the design. No analogies anywhere in an issue, for the reason given in that note.

Assume as well that they have not opened the files and will not open them while reading. Each section opens with a plain sentence saying what the thing is and what it is for, and the identifiers follow it — see [lead-with-what-it-is-for](lead-with-what-it-is-for.md). Problem says what the code is there to do before it says what is wrong with it, and says what the defect costs in ordinary words within the first few lines rather than in the seventh paragraph. A detail that changes nothing the reader would do is cut, table or not.

Use telecommunications vocabulary for the subject matter. Circuit diversity, not mesh degree. Haul, protection, homing. The words for the parts of a backbone are settled in [say-peers-and-circuits](say-peers-and-circuits.md) — circuit, peer, pair, fiber segment, single point of failure, site, backbone node, access node — and that note bans path, route, span, cable and chokepoint as words for them; take the list from there rather than choosing a synonym here. The source used graph-theory words for telecom concepts until issue #38 renamed the backbone setting to `number_of_diverse_paths`; where an identifier still reads as graph theory, take the vocabulary from these notes rather than from the identifier you are describing.

Tables are allowed where a table genuinely reads better than a paragraph: a name-to-name rename mapping, or two measured columns being compared. Bullets are allowed only when enumerating a list of things. Do not use bullets to break up an argument — an argument is prose.

Back a claim with a number computed from the repository's own data wherever a number is available, and say how it was computed so a reader can redo it. Prefer bounds that survive new data being added over exact figures that go stale the moment somebody transcribes another map.

Issue bodies are not hard-wrapped, like all markdown here — see [markdown-is-not-hard-wrapped](markdown-is-not-hard-wrapped.md). The tier vocabulary and what each tier is for come from `docs/tenets/tests/` — see [read-test-tenets-first](read-test-tenets-first.md).

Issues #38, #39 and #40, written on 2026-07-31, are the worked examples of the prose. They predate the regression section, which was added on 2026-08-01, and each names its coverage inside the solution instead. The two-section form for everything outside the program was settled later the same day.

They are examples of the sentences and not of the order, which they get wrong. For the order, read the seven issues open on 2026-08-02, all rewritten that day to say what the thing is and what it costs before naming a file: #47 is the closest one to read beside its own earlier draft, since the rule in [lead-with-what-it-is-for](lead-with-what-it-is-for.md) was written from it.
